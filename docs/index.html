		<h1>This is an example of an HTML page on github pages </h1>
		<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a 
			 long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
		<h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
		<p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure of what 
			 is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings).
			 </p>
		<h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
		<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
